# Activity 4: Bootstrap    

This project is a continuation of the last project from our media queries demo/lecture in web development. This time, we were tasked to make the site responsive by applying our new learnings of Bootstrap by modifying the source code and removing media queries from it. The process of modification/customization gave us the proper understanding of making responsive sites by implementing pure bootstrap in the html document.
